# Magic-Hex

A JS implementation of the magic hexagon problem

## Description 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_hexagon
The normal magic hexagon is a hexagon built of other hexagons, such that each edge adds up to the same number and each number 1 through number of other hexagons is used once. Turns out, this exists for 1 hexagon (adding up to 1), and for 19 hexagons (adding up to 38). There's no way to solve the 19 normal magic hexagon, without some guess work. Luckily computers are good at guess work.
